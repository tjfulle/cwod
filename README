DESCRIPTION
-----------
cwod (Climbing Workout Of the Day) is a small python (command line) program
that generates a rock-climbing centric workout of the day from a database of
workouts.

WORKOUT DATABASE
----------------
Workouts are generated by parsing the daily.cfg database file, a file written
in the python config language. The workouts are not original to me, I merely
collected them from several sources (indicated by the 'cite' option in each
workout). That being the case, I have not attached the MIT license to the
database file since I am not the content creator.

TO DO
-----
1) Create django app with html interface
2) Convert database file to a more stable format (SQL or other)
3) Add more workouts
