     between each.

  2) double armed dead hang on middle two fingers open handed. (hold 5 - large
     edge) hang for 6 seconds, repeat 2 times resting 1.5 minutes between
     each.

  3) hang open handed on three fingers on one arm. (hold 2 or 5) decrease
     resistance as required until hang can be completed. hang for 6 seconds,
     repeat 3 times ea. arm, resting 1 minute between hangs on alternative
     arms.

  *) rest 5 minutes.

  4) double armed hang on full crimp position, on a first joint edge. (hold 1
     or 5) hang for 6 seconds, repeat three hangs resting 1.5 minutes between
     each.

  5) double armed hang on full crimp, this time slightly smaller than the last
     set, (hold 3 or 4) hang for 6 seconds, repeat three hangs resting 1.5
     minutes between each.

  6) single arm hang on 1st joint edge (hold 1, 5, or 4 depending on level)
     decrease resistance if required until hang can be completed. hang for 6
     seconds, repeat 3 sets for ea. arm, resting 1 minute between hangs on
     alternative arms.

  *) rest 5-8 minutes (and prepare for some arm and body work!)

  7) single arm lock off at 90 degrees see pics (hold 1 or 5) if required use
     the assistance of a bungee cord or pulley system. try to stay as open as
     possible rather than twisting your body in to lock off. lock off for
     between 8 and 10 seconds. 3 reps for ea. arm, resting 2 minutes between
     each rep.

  8) one armed pull ups, again assistance may be required using a bungee cord
     or a pulley system. (hold 1) keeping your body as open as possible try to
     complete 2 one armed pull ups for each set and complete 2 sets for each
     arm.

  9) leg lifts/front levers. depending on your ability either do front levers
     or leg lifts. (hold 1) if doing front levers, complete three sets of
     front levers holding each set for 5 to 8 seconds. if doing leg lifts
     complete three sets of leg lifts. for each set lift legs up to chest
     level 6 times.

[SCC Same-Side-In Traverse]

description: this traverse is a natural next step from the backward traverse
  and pivoting exercises. this time it's not necessary to keep your toes
  pointing continuously in the same direction, but every time you want to move
  your right hand, you must first turn your right side in to the wall, and vice
  versa hence the name same-side-in traverse. in order to accomplish this, you
  must turn your body 180 degrees between each hand move. your goal is to turn
  smoothly, focusing on positioning your body.




[SCC Campus Board Two-Handed Throws And Weighted Deadpoints (Ballistic Approach)]
cite: %(scc)s
type: conditioning&recruitment
equipment: campus board
rope_reqd: false
level: 6
description: ballistic training with a campus board is simply weighted throws.
  using a weight vest, perform two-handed campus throws by dead hanging from one
  rung, pulling up forcefully, and then simultaneously jumping both hands to a
  higher rung. put enough weight in the vest that you can do only three to five
  repetitions. when you can do six reps, increase the weight in the vest instead
  of the rung spacing. to get the most out of this exercise, you must explode as
  powerfully as possible during each throw.




[SCC Pivoting]

description: another important preliminary skill is to learn how to pivot your
  foot on a single hold. the goal is to seamlessly turn your foot, without
  losing contact, from standing on the big toe to weighting the little toe and
  back again. stand up on a couple of low footholds a bit wider than shoulder
  width, facing the wall. now turn both feet and your hips so that your toes
  point to the right and your left hip is in to the wall. both feet should pivot
  on their holds simultaneously. you should be facing right, having turned
  approximately 90 degrees.

[SCC Movement Path With The Side Of The Body In To The Wall]
cite: %(scc)s
type: technique
rope_reqd: false
level: 3
description: find an easy back step on a slightly overhanging wall.
  from this position, reach for a hold that is high and slightly behind you using
  the inward and upward arc, but this time trace the arc with the side of your
  pelvis in to the wall. to begin each move, relax your core muscles, letting your
  body sag slightly away from the rock, and then create the inward and upward arc.
  practice this several times using different amounts of force, but always
  visualize the arc first. do not start the move until you can see and feel the
  shape of the arc in space.

  - straight in -> on thin vertical moves or steep moves that consist of a short
  reach where the center of gravity does not need to rise in order to attain the
  next hold, visualize the path of the pelvis as a straight line in to the rock.
  sag out a little at the start of the move to create some room, and then throw
  your center straight in toward the rock. on the steeper moves, this will be
  more dramatic, on vertical moves, more subtle.

  - straight upward -> this image can be helpful on any long move of offset balance
  to a very bad hold, especially a sloper. in such moves, any outward force at
  the end of the move is likely to destabilize your body and pull you off the
  hold. all the forces working on the center must be perfectly balanced at the
  end of the move so the center remains stable as you attain the new hold.
  visualizing the straight line is a good way to create the balanced forces that
  these moves need.

  - corkscrew -> use this image on dramatic turns, such as dynamic drop knees, when
  your starting position has you facing the rock and you are dramatically rotated
  by the end of the move. this image is not literal, but it does help in getting
  climbers to twist and turn further than they normally would in a move.

[SCC Climbing Balance]
cite: %(scc)s
type: technique
rope_reqd: false
level: 0
description: first, get on the wall with your feet apart. back-step your right
  foot, and keep your hands on good holds. sink down low with your arms straight
  and your legs bent. your base is a good-sized trapezoid around your body, a
  position of stable balance. slowly stand all the way up, and reach for a
  higher hold with your right hand. what do you feel happening as you move?
  letting go to reach with your right hand does not make a significant change to
  the size or shape of your base, and even though your center of gravity has
  moved, it stays within your base of support. the result is little change in
  the type or quality of your balance as you move. your balance remains stable
  for the entire move, and you can feel this kinesthetically. stable balance
  feels good and solid and makes it easy to smoothly link moves together in
  fluid sequences, because your center of gravity is almost always well
  positioned within its base. of course, skilled climbers can make any move look
  smooth, but it takes less effort to do so in situations of stable balance.
  routes that are thought of as classics for the way their moves flow together
  have many stable balance moves.

  great deal of the work of turning. after you are comfortable with the
  straight-arms version of the same-side-in traverse, perform it with a
  concentrated effort to use your knees to turn your body. for each turn, can
  you move your body by turning your knee inward first and letting this motion
  naturally lead your pelvis and trunk into turning?

  belayer. this exercise works best in a gym where you can choose among the
  holds already on the wall to allow the ideal level of intensity. many gyms
  place a variety of handholds six to eight feet off the padding all the way
  around the gym, making for a single-length traverse of up to two hundred feet.
  this exercise session should last for thirty to forty-five minutes.

  will look different. if your partner can't tell, take a look at the examples
  on the dvd and compare them to your own movements.
